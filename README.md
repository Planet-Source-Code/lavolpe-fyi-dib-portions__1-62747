### Description

Nothing special. An example on how to extract a portion of an image or DC into a DIB Section. The project basically is gray scaling, but the guts of the project can be used for most image byte processing. I wanted a way to extract only a small piece (16x16) of a large bitmap, but didn't want to extract the entire bitmap into an array. Also, I needed to be able to update only that small section (16x16) in the appropriate location. This sample project shows how I plan on doing it &amp; thought it might be of use to some of you too. The routines, by using DIB Sections, are extremely fast, regardless of the size of the target. Tweaked just a bit: 3 Oct/15:00 est
